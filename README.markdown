RSWG
---

The purpose of [RSWG](http://github.com/ryantm/rswg/) is to provide one Rakefile that can generate most static websites. It's goal is to solve general static website generation problems in one readable file. Ideally a person using RSWG would first read the Rakefile from top to bottom to understand exactly how the website generator works.
